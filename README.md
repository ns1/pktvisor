pktvisor summarizes network data streams in real time, enabling on-node and centralized data visibility and analysis.

Summarized information includes, for example:
* Packet rates: 50th, 90th, 95th, 99th percentiles
* Packet counts by protocol and IP version
* Cardinality of set of source IPs and DNS qnames seen in window
* Top 10 heavy hitters: IPs, ASNs, Geo, DNS qnames, DNS slow xacts...

Although currently DNS and packet capture focused, it is designed to be used in broader contexts.

Overview
---

pktvisor consists of:

1. A collector daemon which efficiently summarizes streams and exposes a REST API for results and control plane
1. A terminal based, command line UI which can visualize the real-time summarized data
1. Tools for collecting and visualizing a globally distributed set of agents to a central location

The agent can also summarize pcap files.

API Documentation
---
The REST API documentation, including a description of the metrics that are available, is available in OpenAPI format.
See the `docs/` directory.


Getting Started
---

The easiest way to get started with pktvisor is to use
the [public docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ns1labs/pktvisor). The image contains the command line
UI (`pktvisor-cli`), the pcap file analyzer (`pktvisor-pcap`), and the collector daemon (`pktvisord`).

1. *Pull the container*
```
docker pull ns1labs/pktvisor
``` 
2. *Start the collector daemon* 

This will run in the background and stay running. Note that the final two arguments request `pktvisord` binary (with the
final 'd' for daemon), and to packet capture on the `any` ethernet interface. You may substitute that for a known
interface on your device. Note that this requires docker host networking to observe traffic outside the container:
```
docker run --rm --net=host -d ns1labs/pktvisor pktvisord any
```
3. *Run the command line UI*

After the collector is running, you can visualize results locally with the included UI. This command will run the
command line UI (`pktvisor-cli`) in the foreground, and exit when Ctrl-C is pressed
```
docker run -it --rm --net=host ns1labs/pktvisor pktvisor-cli
```

See usage examples below for more complex scenarios, including specification of the local host IP(s) and Geo support.

There are currently no prebuilt operating system packages. If you would like to build your own executable,
please see the Build section below.

Collector Daemon Usage
---

A collector daemon should be installed on each node to be monitored.

Current command line options are described with:

```
pktvisord --help
```

```

    Usage:
      pktvisord [options] [IFACE]
      pktvisord (-h | --help)
      pktvisord --version

    pktvisord summarizes data streams and exposes a REST API control plane for configuration and metrics.

    IFACE, if specified, is either a network interface or an IP address (4 or 6). If this is specified,
    a "pcap" input stream will be automatically created, with "net" and "dns" handler modules attached.
    ** Note that this is deprecated; you should instead use --full-api and create the pcap input stream via API.

    Base Options:
      -l HOST               Run webserver on the given host or IP [default: localhost]
      -p PORT               Run webserver on the given port [default: 10853]
      --full-api            Enable full REST API giving complete control plane functionality [default: false]
                            When not specified, the exposed API is read-only access to summarized metrics.
                            When specified, write access is enabled for all modules.
      -h --help             Show this screen
      -v                    Verbose log output
      --version             Show version
      --geo-city FILE       GeoLite2 City database to use for IP to Geo mapping (if enabled)
      --geo-asn FILE        GeoLite2 ASN database to use for IP to ASN mapping (if enabled)
    Handler Module Defaults:
      --max-deep-sample N   Never deep sample more than N% of streams (an int between 0 and 100) [default: 100]
      --periods P           Hold this many 60 second time periods of history in memory [default: 5]
    pcap Input Module Options (deprecated, use full-api instead):
      -b BPF                Filter packets using the given BPF string
      -H HOSTSPEC           Specify subnets (comma separated) to consider HOST, in CIDR form. In live capture this /may/ be detected automatically
                            from capture device but /must/ be specified for pcaps. Example: "10.0.1.0/24,10.0.2.1/32,2001:db8::/64"
                            Specifying this for live capture will append to any automatic detection.

```

Command Line UI Usage
---

The command line UI (`pktvisor-cli`) connects to a collector daemon to visualize the real time stream summarization. It
can connect to a local or remote agent.

Advanced Collector Daemon Usage Examples
---

Starting the collector daemon from Docker with MaxmindDB and Host options:

```
docker run --rm --net=host -d --mount type=bind,source=/opt/geo,target=/geo ns1labs/pktvisor pktvisord --geo-city /geo/GeoIP2-City.mmdb --geo-asn /geo/GeoIP2-ISP.mmdb -H 192.168.0.54/32,127.0.0.1/32 any
```


Centralized Collection
---

pktvisor may be collected centrally to give a global view of the collected information.

Host Concept
---
Ingress and egress (in/out) related metrics can only be calculated if the agent understands how to identify the host.

Build Dependencies
---

* CMake >= 3.8
* Linux or OSX
* C++ compiler supporting C++17
* PcapPlusPlus https://github.com/ns1/PcapPlusPlus
* Conan C++ package manager
* MaxMind DB libmaxmindb

Building
---

Building is based on CMake.

Default build:
```
mkdir build; cd build
conan install ..
cmake ..
make
```

Building the docker image (from the root project directory):
```
org="myorg"
image="mypktvisor"
tag="latest"
docker build -t ${org}/${image}:${tag} -f docker/Dockerfile .
```
