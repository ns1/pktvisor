# Centralized Elasticsearch Collection

This directory contains resources for building a docker container that contains pktvisord and
the [telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) for collecting and sending metrics to Elasticsearch.

It also contains an example [Grafana dashboard](grafana-dashboard-elk.json).
