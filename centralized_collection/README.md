# Centralized Collection

This directory contains resources for centrally collecting and visualizing the metrics from pktvisor.

Because pktvisor exposes its metrics over a generic JSON interface, it is able to work with any time series database.
This directory contains resources for interacting with common databases.

See the individual READMEs for more information:

* [Prometheus](prometheus/README.md)
* [Elasticsearch](elastic/README.md)
